I was working with other biologists from the North Slope Borough Department of Wildlife Management during the summers of 2012,2013,2014. The net is set out during summer and set up either mid June or early July depending on ice conditions. The first image is what it looks like out of the water while the image on the right is when it is in use. When the net is up and running, it is checked daily. Some days you'll have 30 or so fish, other days you'll have near a thousand, but the average amount is typically 200-500 fish. Fish are then moved by the sections, lifting up the one near the front funnel to be put into the next sections until the end, where they are coming out of the net into a floating type basket net to individually grab and take notes. This process needs at least 3 people. Here's an example on how they're recorded. Some are then taken back to the lab for further research.

Species | Length(mm) | Comments
------------ | ------------- | -------------
Fourhorn sculpin | 240 | a smaller fourhorn inside it's mouth
Artic Cisco | 340 | parisite located on the bottom
Rainbow Smelt | 160 |

I helped with this project in the years 2012,2013,2014. The project main objectives were to genetically identify bears that use bowhead whale carcasses through the hair snares and microsatellite DNA.Also to determine visation rates, if high enough, to make population estimates using mark recapture feasible. Then compare with the bone piles of Kaktovik and Utqiagvik(Barrow). The hair snare is put up at the most northern place of Alaska, Point Barrow

The method of putting up the fence is that each post is roughly 10 meters apart from each other and the fence height is only .5 meters so that they can easily go over it. The spacing for same hair sampling is .75 meters apart when multiple hairs on clumped in an area. Fence is checked about every other day and if there is a bear in sight, we don't approach and turn back to the college(where NSB-DWM is stationed)
